# Structure

In the directory you will find differing mag files. The main two that are worked on are BitcellResis and BitCellNoResis.
These two files contain the layout design with a traditional poly resistor, while the other utilizes a PMOS acting mostly in triode in the other file respectively.
The remaining files are subcells autogenerated by sky130 in magic based on the requested Widths and lengths.
