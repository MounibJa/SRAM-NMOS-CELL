## Key Differences Between PMOS and Resistor Design

1. Passive power
- This is the one of the biggest wins for the PMOS design, aside from the obvious size during the layout process. The PMOS cell uses significantly less power, which can be seen by analyzing the current leaking through over all possible node voltages. Comparing this to the resistor, the advantage is obvious. Look to the plot below for a clear view of this.
